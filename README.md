# Predicting cryptocurrency markets using subreddit sentiment analysis as a feature in RNN LSTM modeling
This ongoing project was my capstone for my General Assembly Data Science Fellowship. It's a project I'm very excited about, and have many ideas to work with it moving forward. If you have any questions feel free to reach out to me. 

#### -- Project Status: Constant Work in Progress

## Objective
The purpose of this project is modeling whether a specific crypto currency will go up, down, or stay stagnant in price on any given day (stagnant being between -1 and 1 percent change). While this model could be used in conjunction with other investing indicators and tools, it also provides a wealth of interesting analysis for how communities react to and influence crypto-currencies. 

### Methods Used
* Recurrent Neural Networks Long Short-Term Memory
* Sentiment Analysis
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* Web Scraping
* etc.

### Technologies
* Python
* Keras
* Tensorflow
* VADER
* Pushift API
* Beautiful Soup
* Pandas, Numpy, Jupyter
* Plotly
* etc. 

## Project Description
In this project, I combined historical price data with natural language sentiment processing to create a predictive model for the cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Binance Coin. This project came out of the commonly held but rarely achieved desire to create new, applicable indicators for investing in the volatile market of cryptocurrencies. In addition to pure market speculation, it also aims to provide a deeper insight into the way communities behave and interact with cryptocurrencies. The project was designed to be applied in many situations and will probably always be ongoing, but for now the question of focus is as follows: Can we use Neural Networks to predict whether the price of a cryptocurrency is going to go up or down based on sentiment analysis of its respective reddit community and historical price data?
