Technical Report

In this project, I combined historical price data with natural language sentiment processing to create a predictive model for the cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Binance Coin. This project came out of the commonly held but rarely achieved desire to create new, applicable indicators for investing in the volatile market of cryptocurrencies. In addition to pure market speculation, it also aims to provide a deeper insight into the way communities behave and interact with cryptocurrencies. The project was designed to be applied in many situations and will probably always be ongoing, but for now the question of focus is as follows: Can we use Neural Networks to predict whether the price of a cryptocurrency is going to go up or down based on sentiment analysis of its respective reddit community and historical price data?

The data for this project was constantly being transformed, and I did my best to keep every iteration separate within the /datasets/ directory. It's made up of price data, reddit post text, sentiment scores, and target price scores.

The the first method required for this project was acquisition of the data. Through the using of Beautiful Soup and Python, I was able to neatly scrape both price history for Bitcoin and Binance Coin. As for the reddit posts, I used the PushAPI to quickly acquire both titles and post text (where relevant) from certain dates forwards. The next step was performing sentiment analysis on the scraped text. Using the VADER library in Python, I organized a set of scores ranging from negative to neutral to positive. After that, I did a number of transformations on the data ranging from setting a target column of 0, 1, 2 to say whether a price when down >1%, stayed stagnant between -1 and 1 percent, or went up >1% respectively. Sentiment scores were also averaged and matched up to days to better fit with the daily price data. A number of formatting and organization methods were performed. I then prepared the data for the model, train test splitting and scaling before feeding it into an RNN LSTM. You can find the topology of the LSTM in the /notebooks/ directory.

The results of this project were incredibly promising. On its own, it is not yet a powerful enough indicator to be used independently, but it could definitely be used in conjunction with other financial data. Both the Binance and Bitcoin LSTM models were able to beat the baseline, with the latter going from a 36% baseline to 47%. Outside of modeling predictions, the sentiment scores provide tremendous insight into the communities that are associated with cryptocurrencies. Findings such as the intense anxiety during the height of the 2018 bull market or the general recent optimism of the Binance subreddit are both fascinating and useful for understanding how people react to news and price changes.

In conclusion, I would say that the answer to the question of whether or not we can use Neural Networks to predict whether the price of a cryptocurrency is going to go up or down based on sentiment analysis of its respective reddit community and historical price data is a cautious yes. The accuracy scores were not phenomenal, but with some added information and work on the topology of the model I am confident that they can be improved. Even as is, the analysis and models could both quickly be put into production as proper investing tools and expanded to suit the needs of other communities and currencies.
